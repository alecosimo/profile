			In what follows, you will find a brief description of
			the main projects in which I have been involved. Much of
			the ideas that I present were coded almost entirely by
			me as extensions of a pre-exiting large Finite Element
			code written in C++. Unfortunately, this code is
			proprietary software and I can not share the code I
			wrote. Nonetheless, approximately at the beginning of 2020 I started writing from scratch a multibody
			dynamics code named <b style="color: #3DB1FF;">Odin</b> which is able to deal with rigid and flexible bodies
			as
			well as problems involving nonsmooth phenomena such as frictional impacts. This code will be available
			soon as opensource under the Apache2 license, but in the meanwhile you can get to know some of its
			capabilities by having a look at the preliminary results that I show in what follows. If you want to take an
			idea of my
			coding abilities, you can have a look at the code found
			in my github account that I wrote for experimenting with
			FETI solvers (a family of linear equations solvers
			targeting distributed systems). In addition, I can show you the source code of <b
				style="color: #3DB1FF;">Odin</b> if you ask me so.
