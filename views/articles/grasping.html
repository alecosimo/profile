            <b style="color: #3DB1FF;">Odin</b> uses absolute coordinates for the description of bodies comprising
            multibody systems. Each of these bodies can interact through contact constraints or be assembled by means of
            kinematic joints which are modelled as bilateral constraints. When adopting Gauss-Seidel like iterative
            solvers (the <a href="http://gdaviet.fr/doc/bogus/master/doxygen/">So-Bogus library</a> in our case) for
            unilateral constraints, we need to come up with a good strategy for dealing with bilateral
            constraints in such a way that drift is avoided. Therefore, in the current context, the simulation of
            manipulators grasping objects is quite challenging. In what follows, you will find some advancements that we
            are doing in this direction: for the moment, the first tests.
