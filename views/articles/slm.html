	simulation of the Selective Laser Melting (SLM) process is studied. I
	mainly considered the non-linear thermal simulation of the
	process where the solid/liquid phase change and the
	consolidation from powder to solid material are
	considered. The thermal simulation is performed on a moving
	domain, and the material state is computed on a fixed global
	mesh. This technique has the advantage of reducing not only
	the number of degrees of freedom, but also of enabling the
	application of reduced order models for the moving domain
	where a set of partial differential equations must be
	solved. </p>
