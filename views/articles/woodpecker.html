			The study of the woodpecker toy dynamics sets up a good
			example to show the capabilities of the nonsmooth
			generalized-&alpha; scheme within the context of a
			general finite element framework. This example has already
			been studied by many authors who generally adopt a model
			with a minimal set of coordinates and small
			rotations. Here, the woodpecker toy is simulated adopting
			a finite element approach, where the equations of motion
			are assembled automatically, and large rotations can be
			easily considered.
